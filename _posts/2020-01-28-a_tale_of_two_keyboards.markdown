My fascination with programming started at a very early age. My cousin had come home with a command line application he had put together (not that I knew what that meant at the time, but looking back on it, that is the best way I can describe it) in college. The program was simple, you asked it a question and it would respond... but somehow the responses were always hilariously personal. He would ask, "Who is sitting next to me right now?", and it would respond something along the lines of, "Oh, you mean that big-headed kid, Felipe!?". It was amazing! How did the computer know? This started a life-long obsession with code. Years later he revealed to me that the questions he asked were always the same- but by holding the SHIFT and CONTROL keys, he could type in the response he chose hidden beneath the pre-determined questions. Simple, but clever. I had to know how he did it, I had to know how the computer did it. For years, I dove into one concept or another and was always derailed by school, work or personal matters. That passion had to be set aside for what life demanded from me at the time. Now, approaching thirty years of age, I had reached a point where I had to make a choice. By trade, I am a mechanical contractor. My father, being an engineer, made certain my education in the matter was thorough but it was never my dream. Would I lead a successful life in a career laid out for me by my family? Or would I follow my dreams and do what I love? The answer, to me, was obvious!
